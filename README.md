# Open-Source-Decentralized-Resource-Requirements-System
I want to start an open source decentralized System with a Portfolio Fund that is allocated in the broad Global market(Something like VT), Healthy Stable Dividend Etfs(like SCHD,DIVO, maybe NOBL and Dividend Kings/Aristocrats), gold, silver, and Bitcoin(feel free to add Healthy assets). 
The fund Would pay for needed goods and Services of people universally. The funds would come from Many different Future Contributing Play to earn ad revenue apps either that exist now and can be made by developers to contribute, different contribution from services and activities in the apps, donations etc.
The Resources that the fund would provide would be through the passive income generated from the fund and every decade there can be an automatic selling of a % of all the assets to pay a lump sum and increase future passive income for people linked to the fund that can acquire funds, resources, goods and services.
The Goods and services primarily required are Food, Water, Utilities, Housing, Internet/wifi, Transportation, and necessary Valid medical fees. They could also be distributed passive funds apart from the goods and services. At first maybe only the people that contribute and are linked to the system would benefit to
bring in the necessary people to keep scaling it universally to a global level and beyond if possible.
